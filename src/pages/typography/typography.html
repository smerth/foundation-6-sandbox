        <h2>Be part of the community</h2>
        <p><img src="../assets/img/sfroom.jpg" class="float-right thumbnail">Nestled between a yoga studio and a bakery, on
            a quaint street in this community-centered neighborhood, is the 40-room, modern-themed, Landon Hotel, with a
            state of the art massage studio.</p>
        <p>The Landon Massage Center is an internationally renowned center for massage therapy and holistic healing. Guests
            of the Bernal Heights Landon are entitled to a free massage during their stay.</p>
        <p>The Bernal Heights Landon also functions as a gathering place for many of the community’s activities and calls to
            activism. It seems that no one can leave the hotel untouched by the sense of community, peace, and well-being.</p>

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <blockquote>"First off, location, location, location!  The Landon Hotel in Vienna is located in a wonderfully picturesque part
            of town.  The staff were polite and friendly, and the neighborhood really did feel welcoming.  I even ended up
            extending my stay, and the hotel staff made all the arrangements!  Can't wait to make my way out to the Landon
            in Vienna again."
            <cite>Donald Platameyer, New York</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>"On my recent visit to Paris, I decided to stay in the Landon Hotel while visiting a friend.  The hotel was quite
            lovely and the location made it very easy to meet up with my friend.  Also, the room was spacious and the bed
            was unusually comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"
            <cite>Amy Xhou, Los Angeles</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>"A few friends and I stayed at the Landon hotel in London last month and we had a very memorable visit.  The hotel
            is located close to public transportation, which made it easy for us to get around the city.  We loved people-watching
            from the rooftop restaurant, and shared many laughs and wonderful food.  The rooms were luxurious, to say the
            least, and the staff catered to our every whim.  We’ll certainly be back."
