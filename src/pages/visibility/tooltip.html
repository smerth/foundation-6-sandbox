                title="A mathematical constant is a special number, usually a real number, that is 'significantly interesting in some way'.[1] Constants arise in many areas of mathematics, with constants such as e and π occurring in such diverse contexts as geometry, number theory, and calculus.">mathematical constant</span>,
            the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="2" title="In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second.[1] For example, if a bowl of fruit contains eight oranges and six lemons, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Thus, a ratio can be a fraction as opposed to a whole number. Also, in this example the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4), and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).">ratio</span>            of a circle's circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159. It has been represented by the
            Greek letter "π" since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as "pi" (/paɪ/).
        </p>
        <p>
            Being an irrational number, π cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction (equivalently, its decimal representation never ends
            and never settles into a permanent repeating pattern). Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers
            are commonly used to approximate π. The digits appear to be randomly distributed; however, to date, no proof
            of this has been discovered. Also, π is a transcendental number – a number that is not the root of any non-zero
            polynomial having rational coefficients. This transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient
            challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge.
